### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- ✅ Added `output: 'export'` for static generation
- ✅ Added `trailingSlash: true` for better URL handling
- ✅ Set `images.unoptimized: true` for static compatibility

### 2. Server Actions Removed
- ✅ Commented out server-side actions in `src/app/actions.ts`
- ✅ Created client-side alternatives in `src/app/actions-client.ts`
- ✅ Updated components to use client-side functions

### 3. Build Scripts
- ✅ Added `build:static` script in `package.json`
- ✅ Build process generates static files in `out/` directory

## 🎯 Deployment Steps

2. Create a new site/project
3. **Upload ALL contents** of the `out/` directory

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Email Functionality
The contact form now uses Formspree for email handling:
